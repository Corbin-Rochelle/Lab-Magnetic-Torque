# 🧲 magnetic torque lab ✨

🌱 a physics lab about magnets, motion, and learning by doing

this project explores magnetic torque — the twist a magnet feels when it’s placed in a magnetic field. using helmholtz coils and a magnetized snooker ball 🎱, we ran a series of experiments to see how magnetic fields cause objects to rotate, oscillate, precess, and even balance against gravity.

the goal was to take ideas from electromagnetism and watch them happen in real life ✨

## 🌸 what this project looks at

how helmholtz coils create a nearly uniform magnetic field

how a magnetic dipole tries to align with that field

the balance between magnetic torque and gravity

how magnetic fields affect:

oscillations

precession

measured field strength (hall effect)

forces on a spring

different setups, same core idea:
magnetic fields can apply real, measurable forces.

## 🌱 what i learned

theory makes way more sense when you can see it

the same magnetic moment shows up across many experiments

careful measurements matter (a lot)

lab work is basically debugging… but for physics 🧠💻

progress > perfection ✨

this lab helped me connect equations to experiments, build confidence with data analysis, and appreciate how much learning happens through trial, error, and curiosity.

🌟 learning as i go, one experiment at a time
